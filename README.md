# **Problem**
Due to the lockdown, many laborers in India have shifted from large cities to their native villages. Once the lockdown is over, a large subset of these people is expected to search for jobs in cities again. There is no easy way for them to search for a job from their remote villages.

# **Currently used solution**
Currently, the laborers get contracts in the following ways:
The laborers contact contractors who they already know/have already worked with
The contractors contact laborers who they already know/have already worked with
Laborers stand near railways and other known locations so that contractors can go there and get access to them

# **Idea**
A web platform where laborers can find contracts from contractors and vice versa.

# **Required attributes**
* Cheap
  * Rationale: Cannot expect laborers or contractors to pay
* No dependency on high bandwidth internet
  * Rationale: Laborers may not have access to high bandwidth internet
* Easy to use
  * Rationale: Labourers may not be good at using computers, websites, etc.
* Multiple language support
  * Rationale: Labourers belong to different regions and not all of them know Hindi and English.

# **Features**
* Contractors can register
* Laborers can register
* Contractors can share the job profile
* Laborers can share their information
* Contractors should be able to search laborers based on skills
* Laborers should be able to search for contracts based on skills 
* Contractors should be able to phone call laborers
* Laborers and contracts should be able to select language of their choice
* Contractors should be able to create opportunities that laborers can apply to
* Laborers should be able to apply for contracts to contractors
* Contractors and laborers should be able to request for new feature, submit queries, complains etc.
* Laborers should be able to register via SMS.
* Once the laborer gets a job they should be able to mark their entry as ‘got a job’
* The contractor should be able to close their entry when they get the required laborers
* Login and logout feature
* Contractors should not be allowed to call more than n people
* Contractors can delete their account
* Laborers can delete their account

# **Risks**
* Language conversion can be difficult 
* Laborers may never get to know about this platform
* Laborers may not have access to the internet
* Laborers may not be able to use a website
* Laborers may be okay with the current way they get contracts viz contact contractors they know and see if they have jobs (i.e. user resistance)
* Identity theft
* Scam calls to laborers
* Laborers work on daily wages, so the data on the website may frequently become stale
* Since it supports many languages, some text on the website may be wrong in some languages
* SMS support can be costly
* Storing so much data can be costly

# **Information required from the laborers**
* Name
* Age
* Work location
* Known languages 
* Phone number
* Aadhar card availability
