# **Problem**
Workers from the informal sector and their contractors/individual employers find it hard to connect with each others. Platforms like linkedin has not been made keeping such users in mind. More recently, due to the lockdown, many laborers in India have shifted from large cities to their native villages. Once the lockdown is over, a large subset of these people is expected to search for jobs in cities again. There is no easy way for them to apply for jobs from their remote villages.

# **Currently used solution**
Currently, the laborers get contracts in the following ways:
- The laborers contact contractors who they already know/have already worked with
- The contractors contact laborers who they already know/have already worked with
- Laborers stand near railways and other known locations so that contractors can go there and get access to them

# **Idea**
An android platform for contractors/individual employers and workers.
